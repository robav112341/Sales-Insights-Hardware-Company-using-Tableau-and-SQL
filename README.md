## Data Analysis Using Tableau 

In order to provide a comprehensive view of the sales data, I decided to develop two distinct dashboards, each catering to a specific perspective - one focused on revenue and the other on net profit. While both dashboards contain similar information, they present it in terms of either profit or revenue, offering a well-rounded analysis of the data.
